# Deep_learning_with_keras #

This repository contains versatile deep learning application implemented in keras. This could be termed as 
sheet code documentation for practical deep learning applications. As mentioned below, topics range from basic 
neural networks building blocks to complex generative models, well structured for easy understanding.

Note:
- All the codes are written in ipython notebook as per each topic.
- Each folder in the repo has a readme describing topics covered(in notebooks) for easy access.
- If required, link to dataset to be trained is provided in explanations.
- Sometime ipython notebook fail to render on browser due to github maintenance. 
In that case either download the notebook or wait for github to resume rendering.
 

*Author: All the code is taken from the book deep learning by python. Similar github repo of the book is available.
However, I have tried to simplify explanation of every details as per everyone's understanding.*
