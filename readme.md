# DEEP LEARNING WITH KERAS

This repository contains versatile deep learning applications implemented in keras. This could be termed as 
sheet code documentation for practical deep learning applications. As mentioned below, topics range from basic 
neural networks building blocks to complex generative models, well structured for easy understanding.

+ **What is deep learning?**
+ **Building blocks of neural network**
+ **Getting started with neural networks**
+ **Deep learning for computer vision**
+ **Deep learning for text and sequences**

Note:
- All the codes are written in ipython notebook as per each topic.
- Each folder in the repo has a readme describing topics covered(in notebooks) for easy access.
- If required, link to dataset to be trained is provided in explanations.
- In case ipython notebook fail to render on the browser(due to github maintenance), either download the 
notebook or wait for github to resume rendering.
 

*Author: All the code is taken from the book "deep learning by python". Similar github repo of the book is available.
However, I have tried to simplify explanation of every details as per everyones' understanding.*
