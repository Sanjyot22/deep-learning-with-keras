# Deep_learning_with_keras 

This repository contains versatile deep learning application implemented in keras. This could be termed as 
sheet code documentation for practical applications. As mentioned below, topics range from basic 
neural networks building blocks to complex generative models, well structured for easy understanding.

## Deep learning verticals covered:
+ *What is deep learning?*
+ *The mathematical building block of neural networks*
+ *Getting started with neural networks*
+ *Fundamentals of machine learning*
+ *Deep learning for computer vision*
+ *Deep learning for text and sequences*
+ *Advanced deep learning practices*
+ *Generative deep learning*
 
*Author: All the code is taken from the book deep learning by python. Similar github repo of the book is available.
However, I have tried to simplify explanation of every details as per everyone's understanding.*
