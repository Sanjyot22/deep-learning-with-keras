# Fundamentals of machine learning

### Important topics covered

In summary, this is the universal workflow of machine learning:
1) Define the problem at hand and the data you will be training on; collect this data or annotate it with labels if need be.
2) Choose how you will measure success on your problem. Which metrics will you be monitoring on your validation data?
3) Determine your evaluation protocol: hold-out validation? K-fold validation? Which portion of the data should you use for validation?
4) Develop a first model that does better than a basic baseline: a model that has "statistical power".
5) Develop a model that overfits.
6) Regularize your model and tune its hyperparameters, based on performance on the validation data.
